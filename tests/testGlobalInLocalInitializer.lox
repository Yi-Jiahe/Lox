/* Resolving and Binding | Challenges
2. How do other languages you know handle local variables that refer to the same name in their initializer, like:
*/
var a = "outer";
{
  var a = a;
}
/*
This is treated as an error by the Resolver based on the justification that shadowing is rare and often an error.
Perhaps that is true and allowing it would make actual mistakes harder to catch, but this seems like it might be useful.
For example you had a counter for a while loop which you want to reset once the loop is done and really want to use i as the identifier.
In Python there's no declaration, so its pointless, but the result would be overwriting the value of the parent.
